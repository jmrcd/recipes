    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This savoury Filipino dish features tender cubes of beef (usually rib-eye or sirloin) and a flavourful sauce. Despite the fact that the meat bursts with flavour, it is a fairly quick meal to prepare and cook.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Adjust the ingredients depending on how much beef you plan to cook. The following ingredients are for a serving size of 4 people.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs of your choice cut of beef, cubed (half an inch or so)</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly season your meat with salt and pepper. Mix the soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil and minced garlic over medium heat. Cook the garlic until golden brown, then remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the beef but only cook one layer at a time. Do not stack the cubes over each other, and sear for one minute. Stir fry for an additional 2 minutes at least, then continue until cooked to your liking. Keep in mind that it will go back in again to incorporate the sauce.</li>
            <li>Once done with the meat, empty the pan and pour in the sauce, let it boil for a few seconds before putting the beef back in. Add the butter, and keep the heat on low-medium, continue cooking and stirring until melted.</li>
            <li>Serve over rice using the garlic as a garnish.</li>
        </ol>
